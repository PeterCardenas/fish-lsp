<!-- ## Summary -->

Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation specifically tailored for the [fish shell](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/tree/main/server/src/common).
This project aims to enhance the coding experience for fish, by introducing a suite of
intelligent features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and more.

<!-- A __feature-rich__, __extensible__, and __blazingly fast__ [language-server](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/tree/main/server/src/common) for the [fish-shell](https://fishshell.com/). -->
<!-- Uses [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), [tree-sitter-fish](https://github.com/ram02z/tree-sitter-fish), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). -->
<!-- Implements both standard & non-standard features from the [language-server-protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#headerPart), to be connected to a language-client ([neovim](https://neovim.io/),[coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [etc.](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp-language-clients)). -->
<!-- __More info on the [wiki](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/wiki).__ -->

The langauge server protocol describes both a server and client communication. Text editor's (_or any other equivalent form of_ __langauge client__) are then able to choose which general
programming features will be implemented. This leaves the possibilities for the server to
be open ended and general. The general goal of this project will be to continue
expanding supported features _(within repsective reason)_ that fish's community can create.

<!-- Here is good description from the author of [fish-ide on VSCode](https://github.com/yourusername/fish-ide): -->

<!-- Supporting this project is mutually beneficial to -->
<!-- the entire community. -->

<!-- Producing a comprehensive user interface that aligns with the ideology of the -->
<!-- __FRIENDLY INTERACTIVE SHELL__ continues to be a difficult task. Supporting this -->
<!-- project is both requested and encouraged until reaching a more mature code base. -->

<!-- Achieving ideal solution's to each new LSP release is unstable by nature, -->
<!-- and has been reworked in multiple instances. Please try to consider the time -->
<!-- and dedication required to achieve the current project's state. -->

<!--

> "[this](https://github.com/yourusername/fish-ide) is a ~100 lines of code project made to fix up a few syntax highlighting bugs, while a real LSP would be more like 10,000 lines of code that requires a lot of knowledge of the fish internals. This is similar to a formatter, which might be pretty complicated to write from scratch, but it was no problem to add formatting to this extension by calling out to the official fish shell's fish_indent executable."

## Viewing the Wiki

The [wiki](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/wiki)  Contains more information on the project. Project is still in it's early releases, so the wiki
information is subject to change. Contains ['minimal' client submodules](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp-language-clients),
useful snippets, and bleeding edge feature documentation.
